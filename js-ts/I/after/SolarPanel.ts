// Adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
// Interfaces are segregated so classes only implement what they need.

/*
*"after" code solves this perfectly by splitting the large interface into smaller, more specific ones: IEnergySource, IEnergyConsumer, and IEnergyStorage. This allows a class like SolarPanel to only implement the interface it actually needs, leading to a much cleaner and more maintainable design.
